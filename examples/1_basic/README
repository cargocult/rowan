This example shows the most basic functioning of the framework.

It consists of a simple server containing a router that recognizes any
query path starting with /foo/. The controller that responds to such
paths loads a trivial template from the disk and merges some basic
data with it for output. 

The example is very simple but shows the basic operation of the
framework.
