This example shows the most basic functioning of the framework.

It consists of a simple server containing a router that recognizes any
query path starting with /foo/. The controller that responds to such
paths loads a trivial template from the disk and merges some basic
data with it for output. 

Note that the git-repository should install a symlink in this
directory to the main rowan module. This allows rowan to be imported
with require('./rowan') from the server.js file. If you package rowan
and place it in the Node library path, you can remove the symlink and
remove the './' from the start of the path. In general, however, I
find it is easier to use the symlink approach.
