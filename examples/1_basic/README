This example shows the most basic functioning of the framework.

It consists of a simple server containing a router that recognizes any
query path starting with `/foo/`. The controller that responds to such
paths loads a trivial template from the disk and merges some basic
data with it for output. There are also two further controllers that
respond to `/bar/` and `/bar/sesame/`, designed to show further
routing and error fallback behavior.

Note that the git-repository should install a symlink in this
directory to the main rowan module. This allows rowan to be imported
with `require('./rowan')` from the server.js file. If you package
rowan and place it in the Node library path, or if you specify it with
`require.path.push("...")`, you can remove the symlink and remove the
`./` from the start of the path. In general, however, I find it is
easier to use the symlink approach.
