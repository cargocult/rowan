Rowan Framework


Rowan is a simple Microframework for node.js.

It is designed as a modular and hierarchical microframework.

Each controller in the hierarchy has the same structure: it takes a
context object that contains both the Node.js request and response
objects. It can either write to the response object, or it can throw
an error to indicate somthing has gone wrong. These controllers are
composed into a tree structure.

Branches in the tree might dispatch a request based on a URL, for
example, or might have a fallback in case their preferred child node
raises an error.

Most often, however, the trees can be relatively flat. They might have
an error_handler node at their root (which catches and reports any
problems in the tree), then a single router which forwards different
urls to controllers that generate the correct output. This pattern is
shown in the first example application.

The code is based on my Python/WSGI Rowan framework code (on github at
http://github.com/idmillington/Rowan-Python). There are two major
differences between this Node.js implementation and that:

1. This version doesn't have the hierarchical blackboard data
structure that can be useful for hiding data from controllers. I might
add this later, it certainly improves modularity.

2. Because Node.js doesn't have an established templating language, I
have added a simple templating system. Possibly too simple!

I am using this microframework as the glue in an SOA project,
integrating with conventional servers, databases and CouchDB.

Get in touch with any observations or questions.
